# lix-unit

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of nix-unit that works with Lix.

This project runs an attribute set of tests compatible with `lib.debug.runTests` while allowing individual attributes to fail.

![](./.github/demo.gif)

## Why use lix-unit?

- Simple structure compatible with `lib.debug.runTests`

- Allows individual test attributes to fail individually.

Rather than evaluating the entire test suite in one go, serialise & compare `lix-unit` uses the Nix evaluator C++ API.
Meaning that we can catch test failures individually, even if the failure is caused by an evaluation error.

- Fast.

No additional processing and coordination overhead caused by the external process approach.

## Comparison with other tools
This comparison matrix was originally taken from [Unit test your Nix code](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-09-01-unit-test-your-nix-code/) but has been adapted.
Pythonix is excluded as it's unmaintained.
