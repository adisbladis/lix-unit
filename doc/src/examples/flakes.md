# Flakes

## flake.nix

Building on top of the simple classic example the same type of structure could also be expressed in a `flake.nix`:
``` nix
{
  description = "A very basic flake using lix-unit";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    libTests = {
      testPass = {
        expr = 1;
        expected = 1;
      };
    };
  };
}

```

And is evaluated with `lix-unit` like so:
``` bash
$ lix-unit --flake '.#libTests'
```

## flake checks

You can also use `lix-unit` in flake checks ([link](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake-check)).

Create a `tests` and `checks` outputs.

```nix
{{#include ../lib/flake-checks/flake.nix}}
```

Run `nix flake check` and get an error as expected.

```console
