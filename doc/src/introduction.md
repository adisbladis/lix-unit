# Introduction

## Why use nix-unit?

- Simple structure compatible with `lib.debug.runTests`

- Allows individual test attributes to fail individually.

Rather than evaluating the entire test suite in one go, serialise & compare `nix-unit` uses the Nix evaluator C++ API.
Meaning that we can catch test failures individually, even if the failure is caused by an evaluation error.

- Fast.

No additional processing and coordination overhead caused by the external process approach.
